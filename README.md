# VulnHub Writeups â€“ Penetration Testing Practice

Welcome to my VulnHub Writeups repository!  
This repository contains detailed penetration testing walkthroughs for vulnerable machines hosted on [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/).  
Each writeup follows a professional pentesting methodology and is designed for learning, practicing, and sharpening ethical hacking skills.

  - Service Enumeration (HTTP, SMB)
  - Exploit Research & Weaponization
  - Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  - Privilege Escalation
  - Persistence & Post-Exploitation
- **Exploits:**
  - `OpenLuck` kernel exploit (HTTP service)
  - Samba `trans2open` buffer overflow
- **Outcome:** Full root compromise & persistence established.

## ðŸ›  Methodology

Each writeup generally follows these steps:
1. **Reconnaissance** â€“ Identifying live hosts and open ports.
2. **Scanning** â€“ Service/version detection and vulnerability identification.
3. **Enumeration** â€“ Gathering system/service information.
4. **Weaponization** â€“ Preparing the exploit code or payload.
5. **Exploitation** â€“ Gaining access through vulnerabilities.
6. **Privilege Escalation** â€“ Obtaining higher-level permissions.
7. **Post-Exploitation** â€“ Persistence, data extraction, and cleanup.
